    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Layers of rice, chicken breast, a creamy soup and salsa mixture and two kinds of cheese add up to a simply yummy salsa casserole! This recipe is a family favorite because it's delicious and easily made with ingredients found in the pantry.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups uncooked white rice</li>
        <li>2 ⅔ cups water</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup<li>
        <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups mild salsa</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place rice and water in a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place chicken breast halves into a large saucepan, and fill the pan with water. Bring to a boil, and cook for 20 minutes, or until done. Remove chicken from water. When cool enough to handle, cut meat into bite-size pieces.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheeses. In a separate bowl, mix together cream of chicken soup, cream of mushroom soup, onion, and salsa. Layer 1/2 of the rice, 1/2 of the chicken, 1/2 of the soup and salsa mixture, and 1/2 of the cheese mixture in prepared dish. Repeat layers, ending with cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for about 40 minutes, or until bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
